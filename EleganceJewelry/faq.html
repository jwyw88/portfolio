<p class="body_text">Many people wonder how to take care of their sterling silver  jewelry. When you first purchased that silver necklace, ring or broach it was  shiny and beautiful. In time silver tarnishes from the interaction of silver  and sulfides in the air. First the tarnish will take on a golden hue, and  eventually, it will turn the piece black. This is a natural process. Below is  some Q&amp;A to help you preventing tarnish as well as cleaning your sterling  siver jewelry just like brand new tips.</p>

</h3>
<span class="body_text">Q: How to keep tarnish away from your sterling silver  jewelry?<br />
A: You should do the following:
</span>
<ul>
  <li class="body_text">Remove all sterling silver jewelry when applying  perfumes, hair spray, lotions, and similar items.</li>
  <li class="body_text">Avoid strong chemicals, such as those found in  hair coloring and dyes; these can tarnish silver instantly. Removing your  jewelry when you bath or swim may or may not be necessary; just</li>
  <li class="body_text">Remove your jewelry when you bath or swim may or  may not be necessary; just rinse with soap and water afterwards to clean off  any residual chemicals.</li>
  <li class="body_text">Avoid staining your jewelry with make-up, foods,  and drink. If you do stain your jewelry with the above, rinse immediately with  water and soap (mild, phosphate free preferably).</li>
  </ul>
<h3><a name="cleaning" id="cleaning"></a>Cleaning</h3>
<p class="body_text">Q: what is the most common cleaning method for sterling  silver jewelry?<br />
A: You should clean as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="body_text">Use a soft polishing cloth on pieces you  frequently wear. This helps remove any dirt or oils that may get on your  jewelry through contact with skin and the environment</li>
  <li class="body_text">Silver jewelry that won't be worn for a while  must be sealed in a plastic or cloth bag to minimize exposure to oxygen,  humidity, and damage. </li>
  <li class="body_text">For a more thorough cleaning, detergents can be  used. One method is to place a few pinches of baking soda or other mild  non-phosphate detergents on your jewelry, then wash with mineral free water by  either rubbing with fingers or using a soft cloth. </li>
  <li class="body_text">There are also chemical cleaners available, but  repeated use of liquid cleaners can result in discoloration overtime,  therefore, such cleaners should only be used sparingly and only when other  methods of cleaning fail.</li>
  </ul>
